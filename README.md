# Adventure Wrench
D&D 5e style
Initiative Tracker
Campaign Builder
Encounter Builder
Creature Builder

Leverages modular cascading templates, randomized tables, and dice roll tables.

Lets us build fast, reduces writing, and enhances modular design over
other building tools. So you can focus more on the "feel" of the encounters.

When complete, it will be so fast to create things in this tool, you will be able
to run a game while building it.

I'll be adding templates to the tool to help get people started. But importing
and building templates will be possible.
