# Adventure Wrench
5E compatible
1. Initiative Tracker
2. Template builder
3. Template Randomizer
4. A generated content vault.

Leverages modular cascading templates, randomized tables, and dice roll tables.

Lets us build fast, reduces writing, and enhances modular design and ease of reuse over other building tools. So you can put things together faster and re-use templates easier.

## Ethos:
- Lets be easy to write
- Lets be easier to read
- never ask anyone to save nothin. Just save everything.
- no undo's lol (maybe later)


## TODO:
Setup Controls for "The Shop" the applet that builds things
    to be put into the vault.
