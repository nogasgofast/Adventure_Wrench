# Adventure Wrench
D&D 5e style
Initiative Tracker

Leverages modular cascading templates, randomized tables, and dice roll tables.

Lets us build fast, reduces writing, and enhances modular design over other building tools. So you can put things together faster and re-use templates or share them.

## Ethos:
- Say little
- Reward exploration
- Every piece should be simple to understand.
- Make it easy to see everything.
- Encourage writing
- Encourage sharing.

## TODO:
Add template stacking (do not allow same templates to stack!)
Add Roll tables applet.
Setup Controls for "The Shop" the applet that builds things
    to be put into the vault.
