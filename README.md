Creature Builder

Leverages modular cascading templates, randomized tables, and dice roll tables.

Lets us build fast, reduces writing, and enhances modular design over
other building tools. So you can put things together faster and re-use templates
or share them.

Objective: It should be so fast to create things in this tool, you will be able
to run a game while building it.

I'll be adding templates to the tool to help get people started. But importing
and building templates will be possible eventually.


TODO:
Working on upgrading the look and feel of this application.
Right now working on the players Dialog. The first one people will use
when they open the application.

I've removed it's add button, and I am re-arranging things so when someone
clicks the players button it opens and starts editing a new player.

Additionally if the user double-clicks on a player it should open the editor
for players. Any changes made there should take effect right away on that character.
