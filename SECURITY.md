## Reporting a Vulnerability

I usually respond the same day I see a message. And I check for messages more often 
during the week. Generally I will always update or close an issue right away. So if 
I don't seem to be responding it may be because i have lost track of the issue or am 
otherwise not able to respond for some reason. A poke may be necessary.
