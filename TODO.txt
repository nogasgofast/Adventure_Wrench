Attribute Templates are responsible for tokenizing and computing cascading layouts
for creatures. I.E. applying the brute layout template will add 1d3 random simple weapon layouts,
 and give resitance to piercing damage. And these templates will be what shows up in the
attribute selector. Ideally a preview button will show you what these attributes do.

Implement Editor for spells,attacks,abilities.
I want to have the ability to apply attack templates. i.e. multi-attack:3 spear,club for soldier template
I want to be able to add a few attacks or spells by feel alone very quickly.
I want to be able to add a class of attacks, or all attacks with a perticular attribute.


# Notation Documentation
The file format is a simple INI File Structure as created by python3 configparser.
This library allows the abstraction of those into a GUI. INI file format was chosen as it makes very readable and easy to edit config files. Even if you
say want to edit them by hand.

x I want to be able to define templates that create creature types. e.g. creatures that do poison damage should have an attribute that allows you to apply poison damage to any attack you want to seperately. Con save or full poison damamge. Dex save or full lightining/fire damage.
